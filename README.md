# 3D-Portal
The game Portal recreated using Python, in addition to tkinter and numpy

Project Description: This project is my stab at recreating a game similar to the title created by Valve known as Portal, where the objective of the game is to solve puzzles or "chambers" that encompass a variety of interactable objects such as boxes and buttons to reach the exit. The objective is to navigate and solve these puzzles using portals, which can be fired by the player (maximum 2) at walls or floors that can then be traversed through going from  portal to portal.

How to run: Open file titled "Portal Term Project jsozasot.py"

Libraries: Numpy

Shortcuts:
	Pressing 'c' will spawn a box at raycast point
	Pressing 'p' will toggle ray visualization coming from the camera to the intersection point in the map
	Pressing '(' to go back and ')' to got forward a level
	Pressing ']' while the mouse is at the bottom-most edge of the screen will reconfigure the raycasting in case it is 		not aiming high enough in the chamber
